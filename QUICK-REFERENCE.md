## Container Specs (Quick Facts)

**Dimensions:**
- 20' shipping container
- 19' interior length x 7.5' width x 7.5' height
- ~160 sq ft interior space

**Configuration:**
- FRONT: Full-width doors (7'8" opening)
- REAR: Solid wall + utility connection panel
- SIDES: French cleat rails for modular panels

## Connection Standards (All RV-Based)

| Utility | Standard | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Electrical | NEMA 14-50 (50A/240V) | Same as RV/Tesla charger |
| Water | ¾" GHT + regulator | Garden hose thread (RV standard) |
| Wastewater | 3" bayonet/twist-lock | RV dump station standard |
| Data | Cat6 RJ45 (x4) | Gigabit ethernet |
| HVAC | 12" round duct | Standard HVAC component |
| Propane | ACME/POL quick-disconnect | Optional, BBQ/RV standard |

## Dock Types

**Basic Dock** (Entertainment/Retail)
- Power, data, HVAC only
- Cost: ~$5,000
- Uses: Escape rooms, retail, art installations

**Food Service Dock**
- Above + water, wastewater, propane
- Cost: ~$15,000-20,000
- Uses: Restaurants, cafes, bars

**Residential Dock** (Future)
- Above + hot water, higher amperage, full utilities
- Cost: ~$25,000-35,000
- Uses: Housing units

## Key Numbers

**Container Costs:**
- Used 20' container: $3,000-6,000
- Modification estimate: $5,000-15,000
- Interior build-out: $5,000-20,000 (varies by use)
- **Total: $10,000-40,000 per container**

**Hub Costs:**
- Basic utility block: $3,000-5,000
- Food service block: $8,000-15,000
- Site work per dock: $2,000-5,000
- Central building: TBD (varies widely)

**Mobile Costs:**
- Mobile utilities module: $15,000-25,000
- Truck chassis: $40,000-80,000 (if needed)

## Use Cases

**Phase 1: Entertainment**
- Escape rooms (modular themes)
- D&D taverns / gaming venues
- Murder mystery dinners
- Pop-up immersive experiences

**Phase 2: Food & Retail**
- Mobile restaurants (food truck alternative)
- Boutique shops
- Market vendors
- Event spaces

**Phase 3: Housing**
- Affordable portable homes
- Owner-occupied containers
- Rented dock infrastructure
- Geographic mobility

---

## Configurations

**Hub Docking:**
```
[Building] ⇔ [Container FRONT-doors...BACK-solid] ← [Utility Block]
```
- Container faces building (doors open to interior)
- Utilities connect at far end
- Can back in OR drive in forward

**Mobile/Truck:**
```
[Cab] | [Utilities] → [Container BACK-solid...FRONT-doors] ⇔ [Outside]
```
- Utilities between cab and container
- Container rear connects to utilities
- Doors at truck rear (customer access)

---

## Decision Quick List

✅ **Single utility end** (rear only, not both ends)  
✅ **RV connection standards** (not custom engineering)  
✅ **Rooftop HVAC** (not mini-split)  
✅ **Bi-directional docking** (back in OR drive in)  
✅ **Optional extensions** (core standard + add-ons)  
✅ **Open standard** (not proprietary)  
✅ **Reduced mobile capability** (8-12 hrs, not unlimited)

## Priority Questions to Answer

1. **Is 50A enough for commercial kitchen?** (electrical loads)
2. **Can we meet ADA in 160 sq ft?** (accessibility)
3. **What building code classification?** (temporary vs. permanent)
4. **Grease trap per container or hub?** (food service regs)
5. **What's realistic swap time?** (operational data needed)

---

## Timeline (Aspirational)

**2025 Q1:** Scale model + research → proof of concept  
**2025 Q2-Q3:** Build prototype → 6 month test  
**2025 Q4:** Small hub (3-6 docks) → validate model  
**2026-2027:** Multiple hubs → network effects  
**2028+:** Housing pilots → social impact

## Key Contacts to Research

- RV pedestal manufacturers (Eaton, Siemens)
- Container modification shops
- Escape room operators (test partners)
- Food truck operators (potential converts)
- Housing nonprofits (future partners)
- Local building departments (permitting)
