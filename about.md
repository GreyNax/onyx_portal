## The Project

The Obsidian Portal is an open standard for modular, portable spaces built from shipping containers that dock into standardized infrastructure.

**The vision unfolds in three phases:**

1. **Entertainment** - Escape rooms, D&D taverns, mystery dinners with rapidly rotating themes
2. **Commerce** - Food service and retail that can relocate between cities or operate at mobile events  
3. **Housing** - Affordable portable homes where residents own their space and can take it when they move

By using proven RV and food truck connection standards (not custom engineering), we're building an open ecosystem where multiple manufacturers, hub operators, and vendors can compete and collaborate.

**The long-term goal:** Use profitable entertainment/food business to fund R&D for portable affordable housing infrastructure.

## Why Build This Publicly?

**Transparency builds trust.** By documenting the entire research and development process openly:

- Anyone can follow along and provide feedback
- Potential collaborators can find the project
- The thought process is visible (mistakes and all)
- Prior art is established for the open standard
- Community can form around the concept early

**Network effects require openness.** This only works if many people adopt the standard. Keeping it proprietary defeats the purpose.

## The Philosophy

**Open Standard, Not Proprietary System**

Like shipping containers (ISO standard), USB connectors, or electrical outlets - the value is in universal compatibility.

Anyone should be able to:
- Build containers to the specification
- Operate hub locations with compatible docks
- Manufacture components
- Compete on quality, service, and price

**The network effect is the moat** - more hubs = more value for everyone.

## Current Status

**Phase:** Concept Development & Research  
**Started:** December 25, 2024

We're currently:
- Answering technical questions (70+ identified)
- Designing 1:12 scale model for spatial validation
- Drafting technical specification v1.0
- Researching regulatory requirements
- Building credibility through public documentation

**Next milestone:** Complete scale model and answer priority questions to validate viability.

## Get Involved

**Currently:** Early research phase, not ready for active collaboration yet.

**But you can:**
- Follow along via [RSS feed](/feed.xml)
- Star the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/yourusername/onyx_portal)
- Share feedback via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/yourusername/onyx_portal/discussions)
- Reach out if you're an operator interested in future testing

**Later phases will need:**
- Escape room operators (test modularity concept)
- Food vendors (test commercial kitchen specs)
- Container fabricators (manufacturing partners)
- Hub developers (first location partners)
- Housing advocates (long-term partners)
