# Building in Public

This is a live documentation of developing the Onyx Portal - an open standard for modular, portable spaces that dock into standardized infrastructure.

**The Vision:** Start with entertainment (escape rooms, pop-up venues), scale to commerce (food service, retail), and ultimately enable affordable portable housing.

**Why Open?** This project works best as a commons. The more people who adopt the standard, the more valuable it becomes for everyone. Network effects, not proprietary control, are the goal.

## 🎯 Current Status

**Phase:** Concept Development & Research
**Last Updated:** {{ site.time | date: '%B %d, %Y' }}

### Recent Progress
- ✅ Core container design (single utility end, bi-directional docking)
- ✅ Adopted RV/food truck standards (proven, cheap, serviceable)
- ✅ Defined hub dock configuration
- ✅ Scoped the open standard (core + optional extensions)
- 🔄 Designing 1:12 scale model

## 🔑 Core Concept

### The Container
- 20' shipping container (160 sq ft interior)
- Front: Full-width doors (dramatic entrance)
- Rear: Utility connections (RV-standard plugs)
- Interior: Modular panels on French cleats (swap themes easily)

### The Hub
- Central building (lobby, restrooms, amenities)
- Radial or linear dock positions with utility blocks
- Containers back in, connect utilities, open to building
- Can swap containers in under an hour

### The Network
- Multiple hubs in different cities
- Vendors can relocate containers between hubs
- Take your business (or home) when you move
- Open standard enables competition and growth

## 🛠️ Use Cases

**Phase 1: Entertainment** (Current Focus)
- Escape rooms with rotating themes
- D&D one-shot taverns
- Murder mystery dinners
- Pop-up immersive experiences

**Phase 2: Commerce**
- Mobile food service (better than food trucks)
- Boutique retail pods
- Market vendors
- Event spaces

**Phase 3: Housing** (Long-term Vision)
- Affordable portable homes
- Rent dock space, own your home
- Geographic mobility
- Community-focused design

## 🌐 Why Open Standard?

**Like shipping containers, USB ports, or electrical outlets** - the value is in universal compatibility, not proprietary control.

Anyone can:
- Build containers to the spec
- Operate hub locations
- Manufacture components
- Compete and innovate

**The network effect is the moat** - more hubs = more value for everyone.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

**2025 Q1:** Proof of concept (scale model, research, spec v1.0)
**2025 Q2-Q3:** Prototype (one container + dock, 6-month test)
**2025 Q4:** Small hub (3-6 docks, multiple containers)
**2026-2027:** Network launch (multiple hubs, open source standard)
**2028+:** Housing pilots (commercial funds social impact R&D)
