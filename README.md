# Onyx Portal Project

**A modular infrastructure system for portable commerce, entertainment, and housing**

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The Onyx Portal creates a standardized docking system for shipping container-based spaces, enabling:

- **Entertainment venues** (escape rooms, D&D taverns, mystery dinners) that can rotate themes rapidly
- **Food service & retail** that can relocate between cities or operate mobile events
- **Affordable housing** where residents own their home and can take it when they move

By using proven RV and food truck connection standards, we're building an open ecosystem—not a proprietary system—that allows multiple manufacturers, hub operators, and vendors to compete and collaborate.

**The long-term goal:** Use profitable entertainment/food business to fund R&D for portable affordable housing infrastructure.

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase:** Concept Development / Research
**Last Updated:** December 25, 2024

### Recent Progress
- ✅ Defined core container design (single utility end, bi-directional docking)
- ✅ Adopted RV/food truck connection standards (NEMA 14-50, garden hose, etc.)
- ✅ Established hub dock configuration (utility block at far end)
- ✅ Clarified mobile vs. hub functionality split
- ✅ Created technical questions tracker (70+ questions identified)
- 🔄 Designing 1:12 scale model for spatial validation

### Next Steps
- [ ] Complete scale model design and 3D printing
- [ ] Research ADA compliance requirements
- [ ] Calculate commercial kitchen electrical loads
- [ ] Draft technical specification v1.0
- [ ] Answer priority questions (see `/research/technical-questions.md`)

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions

### Container Specification
- **Size:** 20' shipping container (19' interior x 7.5' x 7.5')
- **Front:** Full-width doors (7'8" opening) for guest access
- **Rear:** Solid wall + utility connection panel
- **Interior:** French cleat system for swappable wall panels

### Connection Standard (RV-Based)
- **Power:** NEMA 14-50 (50A/240V) - same as large RVs
- **Water:** ¾" garden hose thread with pressure regulator
- **Wastewater:** 3" RV dump station connection
- **Data:** Cat6 ethernet (4 ports)
- **HVAC:** 12" round duct coupling
- **Propane:** ACME/POL quick-disconnect (optional)

### Hub Configuration
- Utility block at far end of dock pad
- Containers dock facing building (doors open to interior)
- Can approach by backing in OR driving in forward (bi-directional)
- Covered walkway from building to container

### Mobile Operation
- Truck layout: [CAB] → [UTILITIES] → [CONTAINER]
- Self-contained for 8-12 hour events
- Generator, battery, tanks, solar in mid-section
- Reduced functionality vs. hub (acceptable for mobile use)

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Phase 1: Entertainment (Current Focus)
- Modular escape rooms with swappable themes
- D&D one-shot taverns (Dimension 20-style)
- Murder mystery dinner venues
- Pop-up immersive experiences

### Phase 2: Commerce
- Mobile food service (food truck alternative with more capacity)
- Boutique retail pods
- Temporary market stalls
- Event vendor spaces

### Phase 3: Housing (Future Vision)
- Affordable portable housing units
- Owner-occupied containers + rented dock infrastructure
- Geographic mobility (take your home when you move)
- Community-focused radial hub design

---

## 🌐 Open Standard Philosophy

**We're not building a proprietary system—we're creating an open standard.**

Like shipping containers themselves (ISO standard) or USB connectors, the Onyx Portal standard enables:
- Multiple manufacturers competing on quality/price
- Hub operators competing on location/amenities
- Vendor mobility without franchise fees
- Network effects that benefit all participants

**Anyone can:**
- Build containers to the standard
- Operate compatible hub locations
- Manufacture components
- Compete and innovate

## 🤝 Contributing

Currently in early research/design phase. Not yet open for external contributions, but documenting everything publicly to enable future collaboration.

**If you're interested in this project:**
- Watch this repo for updates
- Check back as we move into prototype phase
- Reach out if you're an operator interested in testing
